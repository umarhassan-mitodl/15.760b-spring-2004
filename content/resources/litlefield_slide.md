description: Slides for the presentation of the simulation assignment. Teams of three
  students will manage a virtual factory in a Web-based simulation exercise for about
  one week. The goal of this assignment is to let them adapt and apply concepts from
  the class in a managerial situation; it will also give them a chance to formalize
  their own decision models and test their relevance and effectiveness. After the
  simulation is over, each team will turn in a written report of at most four pages.
