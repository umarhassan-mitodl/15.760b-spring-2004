description: This handout contains an overview of the simulation assignment. Teams
  of three students will manage a virtual factory in a Web-based simulation exercise
  for about one week. The goal of this assignment is to let them adapt and apply concepts
  from the class in a managerial situation; it will also give them a chance to formalize
  their own decision models and test their relevance and effectiveness. After the
  simulation is over, each team will turn in a written report of at most four pages.
