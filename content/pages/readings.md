1. Draw a process flow diagram for hamburger production in your case. (What are the major process steps and where are the locations of inventories?)

2. For the case you read, analyze the peak hourly capacity vs. peak hourly demand for burger patties. Can they produce enough burgers?

3. In your case, what seems noteworthy about the process technologies in use?

4. Develop a process flow diagram, showing the capacities of the various stages in barrels per hour.

5. Suppose that a peak harvest-season day involves 18,000 barrels of berries, 70% of them wet harvested, arriving over a twelve-hour period from 7 am to 7 pm. Would trucks have to wait to unload? When during the day would trucks be waiting? How much truck waiting time would you expect?

6. How would the various actions contemplated by Hugo Schaeffer affect peak day performance? Suppose the cost of renting cranberry trucks with drivers is $10.00 per hour. What would you recommend? Why?

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

1. Which specific "pitfalls" and "opportunities" (as described in the assigned reading) are most relevant to Barilla's supply chain?

2. Diagnose the underlying causes of the difficulties that the JITD program was created to solve. What are the benefits and drawbacks of this program?

3. What conflicts or barriers internal to Barilla does the JITD program create? What causes these conflicts? As Giorgio Maggiali, how would you deal with these?

4. As one of Barilla's customers, what would your response to JITD be? Why? In the environment in which Barilla operated in 1990, do you believe JITD (or a similar kind of program) would be feasible? Effective? If so, which customers would you target next? How would you convince them that the JITD program was worth trying? If not, what alternatives would you suggest to combat some of the difficulties that Barilla's operating system faces?

There will be special office hours today to answer questions on the Sport Obermeyer Case write-up.

1. Using the sample data given in Exhibit 10, make a recommendation for how many units of each style Wally should make during the initial phase of production. Assume that all of the ten styles in the sample problem are made in Hong Kong, and that Wally's initial production commitment must be at least 10,000 units.

2. What operational changes would you recommend to Wally to improve performance?

3. How should Wally think (both short-term and long-term) about sourcing in Hong Kong vs. China?

Holloway, Charles A., and Charles P. Bonini. "Global Financial Corp." Stanford, CA: Stanford University, 1997. Case No. OIT20.
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

1. For the existing process at Global Financial Corp., compute the capacity utilization of each process step, and comment on your results.

2. Propose an alternative design for the overall loan application process using process design principles, and use both queuing theory and case data to build a predictive model of average total cycle time ("throughput time") for the loan applications of each type (standard and new) under your proposal. What is the reduction in cycle time obtained? You can make the following assumptions:

a) 6.3 effective man x hours per day, five business days per week, 13 weeks per quarter.

b) All inter-arrival times between two consecutive loans of the same type have a coefficient of variation equal to 0.85, and the average arrival rates of the various types of loan can be obtained from the second to last row of the table in Exhibit 1.

3. List the implementation difficulties that are likely to arise with your proposal, and formulate a plan to address them.
